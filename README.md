Spotify-status
==============

Spotify-status is a simple script that allows you to simply display what you're currently playing on spotify.

Spotify-status uses DBUS to ask spotify about what it's currently doing, then stores it into variables. You can then
configure the output by changing the order of the variables.


Spotify-status is based on a script by [skenmy](http://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Linux/Conky-Spotify-quot-Now-Playing-quot-scripts/m-p/26825/highlight/true#M216).
